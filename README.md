# Matrix-Custom-Library

A custom library which can be used to work with matrices. This C++ project contains all C++ Object Oriented programming Concepts.

Constructors or Destructors - Inheritance - Function Overloading - Function Overriding - Operator Overloading - Friend Function - Virtual Function - Templates

## Operations 
* Creating a Matrix (by specifying data and dimensions, dimensions only or without any specifics)
* Creating Identity matrix
* Extracting values
* Addtion, Substraction, Multiplication and division of matrices
* Matrix Multiplication
* Transpose 
* Determinant
* Inverse
* Get or set dimensions
* Get rows or columns
* pop or remove rows or columns
* Bind new rows or columns
* If the matrix is empty or square matrix
* Creating a matrix for simple linear regression
* Finding Coefficient of regression
* Prediction
* Printing matrices

For almost all operations there are 2 functions with different signatures

## Testing
A matrixTest.cpp file is provided along with output.txt which demonstrates some of the operations.
